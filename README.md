# SantaUI
Modified version for 2.4.3 which add Spell icons bigger, Bags and Menu are not hidden and are at bottom right corner.
Shift forms/Stance, stealth, ect... are still hidden and can be shown with mouseover. (Second screen) 

The pet bar can be moved with alt+click on the first spell of the bar. The bag bar can be moved like that too on the first bag.
